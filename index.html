        <h2>About FLaWeD</h2>

<p>Initially, the idea for FLaWeD was to be a one-stop-shop for someone that doesn't have time to visit all their favorite websites in the day.  I wanted to make it such that, upon logging in, the user would see an (at least semi-) live representation of what was on the websites they would look at every day all in one place.  They would even be able to schedule a refresh time for the site so they would know if something had changed since the last time they checked it.  Thus comes the name ... FLaWeD stands for "Favorite Live Web Database".  Then there is the social media aspect: "Share your FlAWs!"  Using Facebook and Twitter, the user would be able to show other people what they were up to.</p>

<p>As you can see, it's nowhere close to that level, but I hope that you can see what I was shooting for.</p>

<h2>A Little "About Me"</h2>

<h3>You're only 22? WHAT?!</h3>

<p>Yup, I just graduated last May from the Colorado School of Mines and have been with Comcast for almost 3 years now.</p>

<p>The team I joined at Comcast was, at the time, in the middle of an architectural overhaul and had decided to make Ruby their language of choice for projects going forward because of it's maintainability and expressiveness over Perl and PHP.  They hired me to assist the team's other developer by creating break-fix tools for customer premise equipment that would be consumed by Comcast employees across the nation. And thus, I entered the world of Ruby and Rails (back when Rails 3.0 had just been released).</p>

<p>Since then, I've written, and still maintain, upwards of nine Rails apps with backend applications that are deployed internally at Comcast including one for the national mentoring program and one for managing soft-switch backup processes and files.  After a year and a few days, the other developer on the team received an offer from another team and I've been flying solo since - writing Rails apps and Ruby scripts on top of my responsibilities to the day-to-day Operational grind.  Two years later, I graduated and was hired on full-time.</p>

<h3>Ok, so what about outside of work?</h3>

<p>Recently, my major project has been the implementation of one of my favorite party games (a blending of Balderdash and Apples to Apples) as a web app after the style of Dice with Buddies or Words with Friends.  Let me know if you're interested and I'll grant you access to the Github repo.</p>

<p>When I'm not working on a coding project, or working in general, my second passion is music.  A band and choir geek throughout school (and a Drum Major in marching band), I feel that my life would be miserable without it.  To keep my skills up, I still play piano and sing as much as I can.  Other than that, I enjoy video gaming (working on Borderlands 2 currently), and bike riding.</p>

<h3>Why 37signals?</h3>

<p>I follow your work.  Though I've never personally used your software, you're practically legendary!  You are the ones people think of when they think of Rails.  You are a HUGE part of the Rails community and I would love to be able to learn from you.  </p>

<p>I know I'm not the best at what I do, but I'm pretty darn good, and I know I have the potential to be great. I'm certain that with the support of a company like you, we can realize all my latent abilities together.  I have a drive like you wouldn't believe and you won't be disappointed if you make the investment.</p>
